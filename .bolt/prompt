For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Also: I have a floating voice assistant called Oliver, powered by Vapi (vapi.ai). Do not remove or overwrite the assistant script or its logic. The assistant should always appear as a floating microphone button in the bottom-right corner, and it must not interfere with the page layout or React rendering.

If you modify `index.html`, make sure the floating button works and the page doesn’t go blank. If there’s ever a styling or layout issue caused by the assistant, preserve the layout and fix the assistant styling instead.
