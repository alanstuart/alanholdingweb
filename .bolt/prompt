Also: I have a floating voice assistant called Oliver, powered by Vapi (vapi.ai). Do not remove or overwrite the assistant script or its logic. The assistant should always appear as a floating microphone button in the bottom-right corner, and it must not interfere with the page layout or React rendering.
