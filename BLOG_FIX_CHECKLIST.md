# Blog Not Visible - Fix Checklist

## Problem Summary
Your blog functionality is working perfectly, and your database has 6 blog posts ready to display. However, the blog is not visible online because **Netlify doesn't have the environment variables** needed to connect to your Supabase database.

## Solution: Add Environment Variables to Netlify

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
- Visit: https://app.netlify.com
- Log in to your account
- Click on your site (alanholding.co.uk)

#### 2. Add Environment Variables
- In your site dashboard, click **"Site settings"** (top menu)
- In the left sidebar, under "Build & deploy", click **"Environment variables"**
- Click **"Add a variable"** button

#### 3. Add First Variable
```
Key:   VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://gxohsuckrfwmzqnzvxjn.supabase.co
```
Click "Save"

#### 4. Add Second Variable
Click "Add a variable" again:
```
Key:   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imd4b2hzdWNrcmZ3bXpxbnp2eGpuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjE1MTc5MTMsImV4cCI6MjA3NzA5MzkxM30.apGis9krTyPZGC-QQpwPhw-ZsKV7jxJzIG7apgPeBBw
```
Click "Save"

#### 5. Trigger New Deployment
- Go to the **"Deploys"** tab
- Click **"Trigger deploy"** button (top right)
- Select **"Deploy site"**
- Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

#### 6. Test Your Blog
Once deployment is complete:
- Visit: https://alanholding.co.uk/blog
- You should see 6 blog posts displayed
- Test clicking on a blog post to view details
- Verify the back button works

### After Fix

## Your Current Blog Posts

## Troubleshooting

### If blog still doesn't show after deployment:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or try opening in incognito/private mode

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Click "Console" tab
   - Refresh the page
   - Look for any error messages
   - If you see "Missing Supabase environment variables", the variables weren't saved correctly

3. **Verify Variables in Netlify**
   - Go back to Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Make sure both variables are listed
   - Check there are no extra spaces in the values
   - If incorrect, delete and re-add them

4. **Check Deploy Logs**
   - Go to Deploys tab
   - Click on the latest deploy
   - Check "Deploy log" for any errors during build

5. **Try Manual Redeploy**
   - In Netloys Deploys tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"
   - This forces a fresh build
