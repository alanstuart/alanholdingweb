# Website Blank Screen - Complete Diagnosis & Resolution

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

Your website was displaying as blank online due to **TWO CRITICAL ISSUES**:

### Issue #1: Missing Build Files (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**Problem:** The dist folder only contained a placeholder file (20 bytes) instead of the actual built website.

**Why it happened:** The build process (`npm run build`) hadn't been run before deployment, so there were no HTML, JavaScript, or CSS files to serve.

**What was missing:**
- index.html (1.82 KB)
- JavaScript bundle (589.75 KB)
- CSS file (50 KB)
- Assets directory

**Resolution:** Ran `npm run build` to generate all production files.

---

### Issue #2: Environment Variable Crash (RESOLVED ‚úÖ)
**Problem:** The Supabase client was throwing a fatal error when environment variables were missing, causing the entire app to crash before rendering.

**Code that caused the crash:**
```typescript
// OLD CODE (Would crash if env vars missing):
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables');
}
```

**Why it's a problem:** In production, if environment variables aren't set correctly, the app would crash silently, showing a blank page with no helpful error message.

**Resolution:** Changed the code to gracefully handle missing credentials:
```typescript
// NEW CODE (Logs error but doesn't crash):
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  console.error('Missing Supabase environment variables. Database features will be disabled.');
  console.error('VITE_SUPABASE_URL:', supabaseUrl ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
  console.error('VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:', supabaseAnonKey ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
}

export const supabase = createClient(
  supabaseUrl || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co',
  supabaseAnonKey || 'placeholder-key'
);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Supabase Client (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`)
- Changed from throwing error to logging warning
- Allows app to load even if database credentials are missing
- Provides clear console messages for debugging

### 2. Created SPA Routing Configuration (`public/_redirects`)
- Added redirect rule for React Router
- Ensures all routes (/, /blog, /thank-you) work correctly
- Prevents 404 errors on direct URL access

### 3. Created Environment Variable Template (`.env.example`)
- Documents required environment variables
- Helps with deployment to different platforms
- Prevents accidental commit of sensitive credentials

### 4. Generated Production Build
- Ran `npm run build` successfully
- Created optimized bundles
- Verified all files present in dist folder

### 5. Created Comprehensive Documentation
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide with platform-specific instructions
- **QUICK-FIX.md** - Emergency troubleshooting steps
- **TROUBLESHOOTING-FLOWCHART.md** - Visual diagnostic guide
- **verify-deployment.sh** - Automated pre-deployment checks

## üéØ What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables on Your Hosting Platform

Your website WILL appear blank online if you don't configure these variables:

**Required Variables:**
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ptsbcrvtcrdsqxoxkkhp.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InB0c2JjcnZ0Y3Jkc3F4b3hra2hwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjE1OTA0MjUsImV4cCI6MjA3NzE2NjQyNX0.XClHW9mhOYti40lL_D34Cvx5pARNxks1lw9MudpBD1k
```

**How to add them:**

**If using Netlify:**
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com ‚Üí Your Site
2. Click: Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Click: Add a variable
4. Add both variables above
5. Click: Deploys ‚Üí Trigger Deploy ‚Üí Deploy Site

**If using Vercel:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add both variables above
4. Go to: Deployments ‚Üí Click latest ‚Üí Redeploy

**If using another platform:**
- Look for "Environment Variables" or "Build Environment" in settings
- Add the variables there
- Redeploy

---

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Ensure your hosting platform has these settings:

```
Build Command: npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
Node Version: 18 or higher
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy

**Option A: Git-based deployment (Recommended)**
1. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix blank screen issue"
   git push
   ```
2. Your hosting platform will auto-deploy

**Option B: Manual deployment**
1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your hosting platform

---

### Step 4: Verify

After deployment:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Clear your browser cache** or use Incognito mode
3. **Visit your website:** https://alanholding.co.uk
4. **Open Developer Tools (F12)** ‚Üí Console tab
5. **Look for:**
   - ‚úÖ No red errors
   - ‚úÖ Page content visible
   - ‚úÖ Navigation works

---

## üö® If It's Still Blank

### Immediate Checks:

1. **Browser Console (F12 ‚Üí Console)**
   - Are there any red errors?
   - Do you see "Missing Supabase environment variables"?
   - Are there network errors?

2. **Hard Refresh**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. **Try Incognito/Private Window**
   - If it works there = cache issue
   - Clear your browser cache

4. **Check Hosting Platform Build Logs**
   - Look for errors during build
   - Verify build completed successfully

5. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Double-check they're set correctly
   - No typos in variable names
   - Values are complete (not truncated)

### Use the Documentation:

1. **Quick emergency fix:** See `QUICK-FIX.md`
2. **Step-by-step guide:** See `DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **Visual flowchart:** See `TROUBLESHOOTING-FLOWCHART.md`
4. **Automated check:** Run `./verify-deployment.sh`

## üîê Security Notes

**Environment Variables:**
- Never commit `.env` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use `.env.example` for documentation
- Regenerate keys if accidentally exposed

**Public Keys:**
- The `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is safe to expose (it's client-side)
- Row Level Security (RLS) protects your database
- Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

---

## üìà Monitoring & Prevention

### Set Up Monitoring:

1. **Uptime Monitoring** (Prevents blank pages)
   - UptimeRobot: https://uptimerobot.com (Free)
   - Check every 5 minutes
   - Alert via email/SMS

2. **Error Tracking** (Catches JavaScript errors)
   - Sentry: https://sentry.io (Free tier)
   - Logs all client-side errors
   - Get notified immediately

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Google Lighthouse (Built into Chrome DevTools)
   - Run after each deployment
   - Aim for 90+ scores

### Best Practices:

1. **Test locally before deploying:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Use the verification script:**
   ```bash
   ./verify-deployment.sh
   ```

3. **Check after every deployment:**
   - Visit the live site
   - Check browser console
   - Test all routes (/blog, /thank-you, etc.)

4. **Keep dependencies updated:**
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   npm update
   ```
